5.3.2 i 5.3.3 -> some complicated if for checking if union contains some specific type
5.3.6 -> watch video

POINTERS:
 &broj		-> get address of normal variable
 num: ^int 	-> declare a pointer of some type
 num = &broj-> assign address of normal variable to a pointer
 num^		-> get value of variable to which pointer is pointing to
				(num^ = num^ + 1)
				(if num was a struct, then we don't need ^
				this "num^.x = 2" is the same as "num.x = 2")
